\section{Conclusions}

In conclusion, Zcash represents a significant evolution in the cryptocurrency landscape, combining blockchain security with transaction privacy. Its advanced technology and focus on confidentiality offer new opportunities for a potentially safer and more transparent financial market.
The future looks promising, with numerous developments underway aimed at further improving its security, scalability, and usability \cite{zcash-future}. The Zcash community and its developers are working on significant updates, such as implementing transaction complexity reduction technologies and optimizing the network to handle a higher volume of transactions \cite{forum}.

\noindent However, despite its technical advantages, the mass adoption of Zcash remains a challenge. Many users and merchants are still more inclined to use more well-known cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Additionally, the anonymous nature of transactions might attract the attention of regulatory authorities, who could see this feature as a risk for money laundering and other illicit activities \cite{zcash-privacy}.

\noindent Finally, the field of privacy-oriented cryptocurrencies is competitive, with coins like Monero and Dash also offering advanced anonymity features. Zcash must continue to innovate to try to establish itself as a leader in the sector.
