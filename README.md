# Zcash: Advancing Privacy in Cryptocurrencies with zk-SNARK Technology

The paper examines the Zcash cryptocurrency, which prioritizes user privacy through advanced cryptographic methods. Unlike typical cryptocurrencies, Zcash uses Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) technology, enabling transaction verification without exposing private details. Launched on October 28, 2016, Zcash originated from the Zerocoin project at Johns Hopkins University, aimed at addressing Bitcoin’s privacy issues. Users can choose between transparent and shielded transactions, significantly enhancing privacy and security. The paper also discusses Zcash’s applications, including limited use on the Dark Web for activities like money laundering and illegal purchases, compared to other cryptocurrencies such as Monero. The conclusion highlights Zcash’s need for ongoing innovation to stay competitive in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency market.
